# **Machine Learning Project: Predicting Healthcare Costs**

---

## **1. Introduction to the Problem**

### **What is the goal of this project?**
The primary objective of this project is to predict healthcare costs using machine learning. We are given data with several features (such as age, sex, BMI, etc.), and the target variable is the healthcare expenses for an individual. The goal is to build a model that predicts these expenses accurately, with a target Mean Absolute Error (MAE) under 3500.

## **2. Understanding the Data**

### **What does the data look like?**
The dataset consists of various features that describe an individual, such as:
- **Age**: The age of the individual.
- **Sex**: The gender of the individual (Male, Female).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index of the individual.
- **Children**: The number of children or dependents covered by the insurance.
- **Smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker (Yes/No).
- **Region**: Geographical region (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest).
- **Expenses**: The healthcare expenses, which is our target variable.

### **Types of Features:**
- **Categorical features**: `sex`, `smoker`, `region` are categorical. These need to be converted into numbers because machine learning models work better with numeric values.
- **Numerical features**: `age`, `bmi`, `children` are continuous values and do not need transformation but should be scaled if necessary.

## **3. Preprocessing the Data**

### **Why do we need preprocessing?**
Before we build a machine learning model, it’s essential to clean and prepare the data:
1. **Handle missing data**: Ensure there are no missing values (e.g., replace missing data or drop rows with missing values).
2. **Convert categorical features to numeric**: Categorical columns like `sex`, `smoker`, and `region` are non-numeric. We need to use one-hot encoding to convert these into binary vectors (0s and 1s).
3. **Split the data into training and testing sets**: We use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. This ensures that we can evaluate the model on unseen data.

## **4. Model Building**

### **What is regression?**
Regression is a type of machine learning algorithm used to predict continuous values. For this project, we're using a **regression model** to predict healthcare expenses based on the given features.

### **Why Neural Networks for Regression?**
We choose a **Neural Network** because it’s capable of learning complex relationships between features. It uses multiple layers of neurons to process data and make predictions. Here’s how:
- **Input Layer**: The input layer accepts the features of each individual.
- **Hidden Layers**: These layers contain neurons with non-linear activation functions (ReLU). This helps the model learn intricate patterns in the data.
- **Output Layer**: The final layer gives the predicted healthcare cost (expenses).

---

## **5. Model Architecture and Training**

### **How does the model work?**
We build the model using the following steps:
1. **Input Layer**: Corresponds to the number of features in the data (e.g., 6 features).
2. **Hidden Layers**: These layers learn complex relationships between features. We typically start with a couple of layers with ReLU activation to learn non-linear patterns.
3. **Output Layer**: A single neuron without an activation function, as we’re predicting a continuous value.

### **How do we train the model?**
The model is trained using the following:
- **Optimizer**: **Adam optimizer** adjusts learning rates during training to ensure faster convergence.
- **Loss function**: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is used for regression problems. It calculates the squared differences between actual and predicted values.
- **Metrics**: We track **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, which tells us how far off our predictions are from the actual values.

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
```

## **6. Training and Evaluation**

### **Why do we split data into training and testing?**
Training data is used to teach the model, while testing data is used to evaluate how well the model generalizes. This helps ensure that the model is not simply memorizing the training data (overfitting).

- **Training set (80%)**: Used to train the model.
- **Test set (20%)**: Used to evaluate the model’s generalization.

### **How do we evaluate the model?**
We evaluate the model by calculating the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** on the test dataset. The goal is to keep the MAE under 3500. A lower MAE means better predictions.

```python
loss, mae, mse = model.evaluate(test_dataset, test_labels, verbose=2)
print(f"Testing set Mean Abs Error: {mae:.2f} expenses")
```

- If the MAE is under 3500, the model passes the challenge!

## **7. Making Predictions and Visualizing Results**

### **How do we make predictions?**
Once the model is trained, we can use it to predict healthcare costs for new data.

### **How do we visualize the predictions?**
We visualize the model’s predictions using a scatter plot:
- **True values vs predicted values**: This helps us compare the model’s predictions with the actual values.

```python
test_predictions = model.predict(test_dataset).flatten()
plt.scatter(test_labels, test_predictions)
plt.xlabel('True values (expenses)')
plt.ylabel('Predictions (expenses)')
plt.show()
```

- Ideally, the predicted values should be close to the actual values, and the points should lie along a diagonal line representing perfect predictions.

## **8. Key Concepts**

### **What is Mean Absolute Error (MAE)?**
MAE is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of the model by calculating the average of absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. The lower the MAE, the better the model's performance.

### **What is Overfitting?**
Overfitting occurs when the model learns the noise and details in the training data so well that it negatively impacts the model’s performance on new data. This is usually caused by too many features or too complex a model.

### **How do we prevent Overfitting?**
- **Regularization**: Techniques like L2 regularization can help.
- **Early stopping**: Stop training when the validation error stops improving.

## **9. Conclusion and Learnings**

### **Key Takeaways from This Project:**
1. **Data preprocessing** is essential before feeding it into the machine learning model.
2. **Regression** models, particularly Neural Networks, are a good choice for predicting continuous values.
3. **Evaluation metrics** like **MAE** help us assess how well the model is performing, with the goal of achieving an MAE under 3500.
4. **Visualization** of results can help us understand the model’s performance and make improvements if needed.

## **10. Challenges and Improvements**

### **Potential Challenges:**
- If the MAE exceeds 3500, the model needs adjustments, such as modifying the architecture, trying different feature engineering methods, or tuning hyperparameters.
  
### **Possible Improvements:**
- **Feature Engineering**: Additional features like interaction terms between variables could improve the model.
- **Model Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning such as changing the number of layers, neurons, or the learning rate might improve performance.
